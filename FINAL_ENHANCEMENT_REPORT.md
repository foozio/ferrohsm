# Final Enhancement Report

## Executive Summary
The FerroHSM codebase delivers a solid Rust foundation for software-based HSM functionality, featuring sealed key storage, hash-chained audit logging with verification tooling, reloadable JWT keysets (HS/RS/ES) with issuer validation, and per-actor rate limiting. Several governance and security controls remain partially implemented (notably advanced dual-control workflows and external audit anchoring). Addressing these gaps is essential before production readiness.

## High-Priority Enhancements
1. **Authenticated Access Layer Hardening**
   - Integrate JWT keysets with managed KMS/HSM services and expose a JWKS endpoint for automated distribution.
   - Bind JWT sessions to mutual TLS client fingerprints where available and surface token issuance metrics.

2. **Dual-Control Workflow**
   - Extend persisted approval system with configurable quorum sizes and policy-driven expiry controls.
   - Expand approval APIs/UI with pagination, search, and notification hooks; integrate audit summaries for closed approvals.

3. **Audit Integrity Improvements**
   - Anchor hash-chain checkpoints to external stores (e.g., S3, ledger) and alert on verification drift.
   - Automate signing key rotation and integrate the CLI verifier into CI monitoring.

4. **Versioned Key Storage & Retention**
   - [COMPLETED] Rotations now persist immutable per-version artifacts with rollback support.
   - [COMPLETED] Automated retention scheduler enforces tag-based lifetimes, dual-control purge approvals with 24h grace, secure wipe attestation ledger, and Prometheus counters.
   - Next: capture off-site retention ledger replication and integrate purge attestations with external audit anchoring.

5. **Observability & Operations**
   - [COMPLETED] Exposed `/metrics` (Prometheus) and `/healthz` JSON with counters for rate limiting, JWT auth, and cache telemetry.
   - Implement configurable logging levels and correlation IDs propagated through traces.
6. **Storage Backend Flexibility**
   - [COMPLETED] Added `SqliteKeyStore`, `MemoryKeyStore`, and `RemoteKeyStore` adapter so deployments can select filesystem, database, or cloud/HSM vault integrations without altering policy/audit layers.
   - Next: deliver managed RemoteKeyVault implementations (e.g., AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault) and define migration tooling between backends.
7. **Governance Data Durability**
   - [COMPLETED] Audit logs and approval records persist to SQLite backends with configurable retention intervals that purge stale entries while preserving active evidence.
   - Next: stream pruned audit summaries to immutable archives (object storage, SIEM) prior to deletion to preserve long-term compliance history.

## Medium-Priority Enhancements
- Introduce pagination and filtering in key listing APIs to improve scalability.
- Add policy scripting sandbox (Lua/WASM) enforcement, honoring tag-based constraints.
- Extend rate limiting to consider API method weighting and burst reporting via metrics.
- Expand SDKs with idiomatic error handling and retries.
- [COMPLETED] Expand integration tests to cover RSA/EC operations, rotation/rollback, revoke/destroy, and policy denials.

## Low-Priority Enhancements
- Provide Terraform/Kubernetes deployment modules with secure defaults.
- Extend web UI to display audit trails, pending approvals, and health indicators.
- Offer PKCS#11 compatibility layer as optional feature.

## Suggested Timeline
| Sprint | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| Sprint 1 | Auth layer hardening, API surface updates |
| Sprint 2 | Dual-control persistence, audit log chaining |
| Sprint 3 | Storage versioning, observability, expanded tests |

## Dependencies & Risks
- Requires secure secret management for signing keys and master keys.
- Remote vault integrations depend on implementing `RemoteKeyVault` adapters (e.g., AWS KMS, GCP KMS) and validating security boundaries end-to-end.
- Audit/approval retention sweeps should integrate with external archival tooling to avoid loss of long-term governance evidence.
- Changes to API authentication could break existing clients; communicate migration plan.
