# TUI Interface Implementation Summary

## What was accomplished

1. **Created new TUI crate**: Added `hsm-tui` crate to the workspace with proper dependencies
2. **Implemented basic TUI**: Created a functional text-based user interface using Ratatui and Crossterm
3. **Added navigation**: Implemented keyboard navigation between different views (Dashboard, Keys, Audit, Approvals)
4. **Created documentation**: Added README with usage instructions and feature overview
5. **Added tests**: Created CLI tests to verify help and version output
6. **Updated workspace**: Integrated the new crate into the main Cargo.toml

## Features implemented

- Interactive dashboard with multiple views
- Keyboard navigation (d, k, a, p for different views; q/Esc to quit)
- Proper terminal handling with panic recovery
- Command-line argument parsing
- Basic UI layout with header, content area, and footer

## How to use

Users can run the TUI application with:
```bash
cargo run -p hsm-tui
```

Or build and run separately:
```bash
cargo build -p hsm-tui
./target/debug/hsm-tui
```

## Future enhancements

The current implementation is a foundation that can be extended with:
- Integration with HSM server API
- Real-time data display
- Interactive key management
- Audit log inspection
- Approval workflow controls
- Enhanced UI components and widgets
