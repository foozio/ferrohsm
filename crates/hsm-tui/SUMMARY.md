# TUI Interface Implementation Summary

## What was accomplished

1. **Enhanced TUI crate**: Improved the `hsm-tui` crate with a more intuitive menu-based navigation system
2. **Implemented basic TUI structure**: Created a functional text-based user interface using Ratatui and Crossterm
3. **Added comprehensive navigation**: Implemented keyboard navigation with menu-based approach
4. **Created documentation**: Added README with usage instructions and feature overview
5. **Added tests**: Created CLI tests to verify help and version output
6. **Updated dependencies**: Added necessary dependencies for HTTP communication and enhanced UI

## Features implemented

- **Menu-based navigation**: Intuitive main menu with 8 options
- **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys for menu selection, Enter to confirm, Esc/q to quit
- **Multiple views**: Main menu, Keys List, Key Details, Key Creation, Key Operations, Approvals List, Audit Viewer, Settings, Help
- **Proper terminal handling**: Panic recovery mechanism and proper cleanup
- **Command-line argument parsing**: Support for endpoint, client certificates, and CA bundles
- **Basic UI layout**: Header, content area, and footer with contextual help

## How to use

Users can run the TUI application with:
```bash
cargo run -p hsm-tui
```

Or build and run separately:
```bash
cargo build -p hsm-tui
./target/debug/hsm-tui
```

## Navigation

- **Main Menu**: Use ↑/↓ arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select, q/Esc to quit
- **Other Views**: q/Esc to return to main menu

## Future enhancements

The current implementation provides a foundation that can be extended with:
- Integration with HSM server API for real operations
- Data models for keys, approvals, and audit logs
- Form inputs for key creation and cryptographic operations
- Real-time data display and updates
- Enhanced UI components and widgets
- Connection management and authentication
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
