# Homebrew Distribution Summary

## What was accomplished

1. **Created Homebrew Formula**: Generated a proper Homebrew formula for FerroHSM that installs the pre-built binary
2. **Automated Packaging Script**: Enhanced the packaging script to automatically update the formula with the correct SHA256 and URL
3. **GitHub Release**: Created a GitHub release (v0.2.1) with the pre-built binary tarball
4. **Homebrew Tap**: Created a dedicated Homebrew tap repository (foozio/homebrew-ferrohsm) and published the formula
5. **Installation Testing**: Verified that the formula works correctly by installing and testing the CLI
6. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for both users and maintainers

## How to use

Users can now install FerroHSM on macOS with:

```bash
brew tap foozio/ferrohsm
brew install ferrohsm
```

## For maintainers

When releasing a new version:

1. Run `./scripts/package_homebrew.sh [version]` to build and package the new version
2. Create a new GitHub release with the generated tarball
3. The script automatically updates the formula file with the new version and SHA256
4. Push the updated formula to the homebrew-ferrohsm repository
