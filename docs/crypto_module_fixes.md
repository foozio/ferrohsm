# Crypto Module Compilation Fixes

This document describes the fixes applied to resolve compilation errors in the `hsm-core` crate's crypto module.

## Problem Summary

The `crates/hsm-core/src/crypto.rs` file had syntax errors that prevented successful compilation:

1. Missing closing brace in a match statement at line 659
2. Incorrect syntax in return statements
3. Type annotation issues in the signing code path

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Missing Closing Brace

**Location**: Line 678 in `crates/hsm-core/src/crypto.rs`

**Issue**: The match statement starting at line 659 was missing its closing brace, causing cascading syntax errors.

**Fix**: Added the missing closing brace and properly structured the match arms:

```rust
// Before (incomplete):
match algorithm.as_str() {
    "ML-DSA-44" => { /* ... */ }
    "ML-DSA-65" => { /* ... */ }
    "ML-DSA-87" => { /* ... */ }
    // Missing closing brace here

KeyMaterial::Hybrid { /* ... */ }

// After (fixed):
match algorithm.as_str() {
    "ML-DSA-44" => { /* ... */ }
    "ML-DSA-65" => { /* ... */ }
    "ML-DSA-87" => { /* ... */ }
    _ => {
        return Err(HsmError::UnsupportedAlgorithm(
            "Only ML-DSA algorithms can be used for signing".to_string(),
        ));
    }
}  // Added closing brace
```

### 2. Syntax Corrections

**Location**: Lines around 680-683

**Issue**: Missing semicolons in return statements

**Fix**: Added required semicolons to make the syntax valid

### 3. Type Annotation Fixes

**Location**: Line 696

**Issue**: Type inference issues with the signing operation

**Fix**: Corrected the type annotations to ensure proper compilation

## Verification

After applying these fixes, the `hsm-core` crate compiles successfully:

```bash
cargo build -p hsm-core
```

The crate now builds without errors, though some warnings remain that can be addressed in future improvements.

## Impact

These changes resolve critical compilation errors without modifying the functional behavior of the cryptographic operations. The fixes ensure that the codebase can be built and further developed.
