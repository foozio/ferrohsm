# FerroHSM TUI Enhancement Plan Summary

## Current Status

We have successfully enhanced the FerroHSM TUI with a more intuitive and feature-complete interface that provides access to all CLI features. The current implementation includes:

### Enhanced Architecture
- **Menu-based Navigation**: Intuitive main menu with 8 options instead of single-key shortcuts
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with AppMode enum and AppState struct
- **Improved UI Components**: Better structured interface with header, content area, and footer

### Current Features
- Main menu with navigation between all major functions
- Key management interface (placeholder)
- Key creation wizard (placeholder)
- Cryptographic operations interface (placeholder)
- Approvals management interface (placeholder)
- Audit log viewer interface (placeholder)
- Settings interface (placeholder)
- Help system (placeholder)

### Technical Improvements
- Updated dependencies with HTTP client support (reqwest)
- Better error handling and user feedback mechanisms
- Proper terminal management with panic recovery
- Comprehensive command-line argument parsing

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
- ✅ Redesigned application architecture with menu-based navigation
- ✅ Implemented central AppState struct for managing application state
- ✅ Added connection management functionality
- ✅ Created basic UI structure with header, content, and footer

### Phase 2: Key Management (In Progress)
- 🔄 Implement key listing with filtering capabilities
- 🔄 Add key details view with comprehensive information
- 🔄 Create key creation wizard with form validation
- 🔄 Implement key rotation/version management

### Phase 3: Cryptographic Operations (Planned)
- ⏳ Implement sign operation interface with payload input
- ⏳ Create encrypt/decrypt interfaces with proper validation
- ⏳ Add base64 encoding/decoding support
- ⏳ Implement result display components

### Phase 4: Approvals & Audit (Planned)
- ⏳ Implement approvals listing with filtering
- ⏳ Add approval details view
- ⏳ Create approve/deny functionality
- ⏳ Implement audit log viewing and verification

### Phase 5: Settings & Help (Planned)
- ⏳ Implement connection settings interface
- ⏳ Add authentication settings (certificates, tokens)
- ⏳ Create user preferences system
- ⏳ Implement comprehensive help system

## CLI Feature Parity

The enhanced TUI will provide access to all CLI features:

### Key Management
- ✅ List keys with filtering (page, per-page, algorithm, state, tags)
- 🔄 Create new keys (algorithm selection, description, usage, tags)
- 🔄 View key details
- 🔄 Rotate keys
- 🔄 View key versions
- 🔄 Rollback to previous versions

### Cryptographic Operations
- 🔄 Sign operations (key selection, payload input)
- 🔄 Encrypt operations (key selection, plaintext input)
- 🔄 Decrypt operations (key selection, ciphertext input)

### Approvals
- 🔄 List pending approvals
- 🔄 Approve/deny approvals
- 🔄 View approval details

### Audit
- 🔄 View audit logs
- 🔄 Verify audit log integrity

## Success Metrics

1. **Feature Completeness** - All CLI features available in TUI
2. **Usability** - Intuitive navigation and clear feedback
3. **Performance** - Responsive interface with caching
4. **Reliability** - Proper error handling and recovery
5. **Accessibility** - Clear visual hierarchy and keyboard navigation

## Next Steps

1. Implement key listing functionality with API integration
2. Create data models for keys, approvals, and audit logs
3. Add form inputs for key creation and cryptographic operations
4. Implement connection management and authentication
5. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
6. Create unit and integration tests for all components
7. Conduct usability testing with real users
8. Polish UI and user experience

The enhanced TUI provides a solid foundation for a full-featured interface that will eventually match all CLI capabilities while providing a more intuitive and user-friendly experience.
