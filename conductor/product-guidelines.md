# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Voice
- **Technical and Precise:** Documentation and user-facing messages must prioritize accuracy and security specifications. Use clear, unambiguous language.
- **Authoritative and Trustworthy:** Maintain a professional tone that reflects the security-critical nature of an HSM.
- **Security-First:** Every communication should reinforce the "Secure by Design" philosophy of the project.

## Documentation Standards
- **Clarity Over Brevity:** Ensure complex cryptographic concepts are explained thoroughly.
- **Comprehensive Examples:** Provide clear code snippets for common integration tasks (e.g., key generation, signing, PQC migration).
- **Consistent Terminology:** Adhere to NIST and industry-standard cryptographic terminology.

## UI/UX Principles (CLI & TUI)
- **High Information Density:** Provide users with clear feedback and status indicators without unnecessary clutter.
- **Safety Prompts:** Implement explicit confirmation steps for destructive or high-impact operations (e.g., key destruction).
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the TUI is navigable via keyboard and maintains high contrast.

## Visual Identity
- **Minimalist and Professional:** Use a clean, functional aesthetic for the management UI and documentation.
- **Functional Color Palette:** Use colors purposefully to indicate status (e.g., red for errors/danger, green for success, yellow for warnings).
