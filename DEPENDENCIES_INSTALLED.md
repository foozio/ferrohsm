# FerroHSM Dependencies Installation Summary

## Dependencies Installed

1. **cmake** - Version 4.1.2
2. **OpenSSL 3** - Already installed (version 3.6.0)

## Environment Variables Set

```bash
export OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3
export OPENSSL_LIB_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/lib
export OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/include
```

## Build Status

### ‚úÖ Successfully Builds
- `hsm-core` crate (core cryptographic functionality)
- `hsm-cli` crate (command-line interface)

### ‚ùå Has Issues Building
- `hsm-pkcs11` crate (PKCS#11 interface)
- `hsm-server` crate (REST API server)

### üîß PQC Features
- PQC (Post-Quantum Cryptography) features require additional dependencies
- Building with `--features pqc` flag currently fails due to API mismatches in the codebase

## Working Commands

The CLI can be built and shows help for these commands:
- `list` - List managed keys
- `create` - Create a new key (AES, RSA, ECC)
- `encrypt`/`decrypt` - Symmetric encryption operations
- `sign` - Digital signature operations
- `rotate` - Key rotation
- `versions` - Show key version history
- `rollback` - Roll back to a prior key version
- `approvals` - Manage dual-control approvals
- `audit` - Audit log inspection utilities

## Next Steps

To get a fully working system:

1. **Fix PQC Implementation Issues**:
   - Resolve API mismatches in PQC modules
   - Fix missing method implementations
   - Correct enum variant names

2. **Fix PKCS#11 Module**:
   - Resolve unresolved imports
   - Fix type mismatches
   - Correct field names in structs

3. **Fix Server Component**:
   - Resolve PQC-related issues
   - Fix method name mismatches
   - Correct enum variants

4. **Run End-to-End Tests**:
   - Once all components build successfully, run `./scripts/e2e_test.sh`

## Current Limitations

- Cannot run end-to-end tests due to build issues
- Cannot demonstrate full functionality without a running server
- PQC features are not available due to compilation errors
