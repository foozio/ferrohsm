# FerroHSM Installation and Setup Summary

## Dependencies Successfully Installed

1. **cmake** - Version 4.1.2 (required for PQC features)
2. **OpenSSL 3** - Already installed (version 3.6.0)

## Environment Variables Set

```bash
export OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3
export OPENSSL_LIB_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/lib
export OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/include
```

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Components
- **hsm-core** crate - Core cryptographic functionality builds successfully
- **hsm-cli** crate - Command-line interface builds successfully
- Basic CLI commands are accessible and show proper help information

### ❌ Components with Issues
- **PQC (Post-Quantum Cryptography) features** - Fail to build due to:
  - API mismatches in the codebase
  - Missing method implementations
  - Incorrect enum variant names
- **hsm-pkcs11** crate - Fails to build due to unresolved imports and type mismatches
- **hsm-server** crate - Fails to build due to PQC-related issues
- **Tests** - Fail to run due to PQC-related code issues

## Working CLI Commands

The CLI successfully shows help for these commands:
- `list` - List managed keys
- `create` - Create a new key (supports AES, RSA, ECC algorithms)
- `encrypt`/`decrypt` - Symmetric encryption operations
- `sign` - Digital signature operations
- `rotate` - Key rotation
- `versions` - Show key version history
- `rollback` - Roll back to a prior key version
- `approvals` - Manage dual-control approvals
- `audit` - Audit log inspection utilities

## Available Cryptographic Algorithms

- **Symmetric**: aes256-gcm
- **Asymmetric**: rsa2048, rsa4096, p256, p384

## Issues to Resolve

1. **PQC Implementation Issues**:
   - Fix API mismatches in PQC modules
   - Implement missing methods in OqsCryptoProvider
   - Correct enum variant names (Level1, Level3, Level5 → correct names)
   - Fix type mismatches (Zeroizing<String> → String)

2. **PKCS#11 Module Issues**:
   - Resolve unresolved imports related to PQC
   - Fix type mismatches in structs
   - Correct field names that don't exist

3. **Server Component Issues**:
   - Fix PQC-related method calls
   - Correct enum variants
   - Fix method name mismatches

## Next Steps for Full Functionality

1. Fix the codebase issues identified above
2. Rebuild all components with PQC features enabled:
   ```bash
   cargo build --features pqc
   ```
3. Run the end-to-end tests:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/e2e_test.sh
   ```
4. Once all components work, demonstrate full functionality with a running server

## Current Demonstration

While we can't run the full system due to the issues mentioned, we can:
- Show CLI help and available commands
- Demonstrate that core components build successfully
- Explain the intended workflow and capabilities

The system is designed to provide a software-based Hardware Security Module with:
- Cryptographic key management
- Tamper-evident storage
- Role-based access control
- REST + CLI interfaces
- Post-quantum cryptography support (when fixed)
- Dual-control workflows for sensitive operations
- Audit logging with integrity verification
